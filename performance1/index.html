    <h2>Brief Introduction</h2>
    <p>I am Ismael Allan Nheil Lomibao, grade 11 student. But most of my friends call me Ian. 
        The oldest son of my loving parents with 2 siblings, I am taking an ICT course at KCM. Simple and shy guy, 
        Thats what others told me. In short, an introvert  personality. I am not  comfortable with the crowd,
        I just want to be alone  most of the time. But inspite of that, I can say that my parents raised me well
        to be a good person. </p>

    <h2>
        To whom are you dedicating your success in finding course? Yourself,familyfriends,special someone etc. Why?</h2>

        family. Especially to my parents. Who are always there supporting me financially physically and mentally,
        without them. I can't imagine my self being successfull and they`re the reason of who I am right now.
